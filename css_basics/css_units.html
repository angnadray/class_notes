    <h2>Absolute Units</h2>
    <p>most used is pixels, do not change size when changing device size,
    not recomended for responsive layoout.</p>
    <h2>Relative Units</h2>
    <h3>em and rem</h3>
    <p>1em is relative to the size of its parent element, 
    when used 2em or more it multiply the value relatively to the parent element.
    rem is relative then no to the parent element but relative to the root which would be body,
    whe can avoid trickle down effect by related to the root.</p>
    <h3>vh and vw</h3>
    <p>vh is viewport height and vw is viewport width, viewport is the size of the browser,
    not the size of the screen but the size of the browser where the info is display.
    It is better to use % in general but vh and vw are way better than absolute values</p>
