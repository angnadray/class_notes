    <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
    <p id="para">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
        It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
    </p>
    <p>A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or 
        as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model 
        (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented 
        representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as 
        JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Core Interfaces in the DOM</h2>
    <p class="par">
            The following is a brief list of common APIs in web and XML page scripting using the DOM.

            document.getElementById(id)
            document.getElementsByTagName(name)
            document.createElement(name)
            parentNode.appendChild(node)
            element.innerHTML
            element.style.left
            element.setAttribute()
            element.getAttribute()
            element.addEventListener()
            window.content
            window.onload
            console.log()
            window.scrollTo()
            <p>Document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most 
                often in DOM programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something 
                like the browser, and the document object is the root of the document itself. 
                Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together these two interfaces 
                provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. 
                These elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data 
                those elements hold, as in the table object example in the previous section.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Testing the DOM API</h2>
    <p>This document provides samples for every interface that you can use in your own web 
        development. In some cases, the samples are complete HTML pages, with the DOM access 
        in a script element, the interface (e.g, buttons) necessary to fire up the script in a form, 
        and the HTML elements upon which the DOM operates listed as well. When this is the case, 
        you can cut and paste the example into a new HTML document, save it, and run the example 
        from the browser.</p>
